        <h3>Solving any Sliding Tile Puzzle</h3>
        <p>
            I once tried to solve a sliding tile puzzle and wanted to know if there was a reliable way to either move a
            piece where you want without messing up the positions of other pieces, or just a general way to solve them.
            I only managed to find the second one, but this general technique for solving a sliding tile puzzle does
            work in such a way that the pieces don't interfere with each other, so my first quest was also completed
            somewhat. I found the way the technique was described a bit inefficient and messy so I tried to write an
            explanation in my own manner. You can read it <a
                href="sliding-tile-puzzle/sliding-tile-puzzle.html">here</a>.
