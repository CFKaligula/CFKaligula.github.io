        <h1> Sliding Tile Puzzle Algorithm</h1>
        <hr>

        <h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
        <hr>

        <p> While playing a sliding tile puzzle I was annoyed how I couldn't find a simple way to solve it, or move any
            piece where I want without messing up the other ones. So as many people do I went to the Internet to see how
            to properly solve one.
            <a href="https://www.kopf.com.br/kaplof/how-to-solve-any-slide-puzzle-regardless-of-its-size/"> The first
                article I found </a> did actually teach the right method, though I feel like it could be described
            neater, so that is why I created this page. Another reason I wanted to make this website was to try out the
            <a href="https://jdan.github.io/98.css/#window">98.css</a> framework, since it looks really cool.
        </p>

        <h2 id="algorithm">The algorithm</h2>
        <hr>

        <p> What I like most about this algorithm is how elegant it is. It works for any size, because how it works is
            that it keeps making the puzzle smaller, so it basically reduces a N×N puzzle to an N-1×N-1 puzzle, until N
            reaches 1. The original source called this a "Divide and Conquer" technique, while I would say the term
            "Recursion" captures the algorithm a lot better. The basic way the algorithm works is by solving the
            top row, then the left row, which removes a row and a column each of
            the puzzle, after which we repeat these 2 steps.</p>
        <p>
            The hard part is then how to easily solve the top row and leftmost column. I will show you how to solve
            these with the steps shown below. Each step I will give an example slide puzzle where in yellow is the tile
            that has been moved in that step to the position in that step. The blank tiles are tiles that can be any
            number still. First we solve the top row:
        </p>

        <h3 id="part1"> Part 1: Solving the Top Row</h3>
        <p>The hardest part of solving a tile puzzle is of course that moving a tile interferes with other tiles.
            Luckily such a problem only crops up in this algorithm after finish almost an entire row. </p>

        <h3 id="part2"> Part 2: Solving the Leftmost Column</h3>

        <p> Now to solve the leftmost row we basically follow the same steps as in Part 1, only vertically
            instead of horizontally. For the first step in our example we won't have to move any tiles, but if it were a
            4×4 puzzle, we would still have to place some tiles in this step.</p>

        <p>
            Just keep following the steps in part 1 and part 2 until you get to the puzzle of size 3x3. You may find
            yourself getting in a bit of trouble once you get to part 2 of the algorithm for a 3×3 puzzle, you have to
            skip step 1 as there are only 2 tiles to place. After solving this part you are left with a 2×2 puzzle with
            only 3 tiles. This should basically solve itself.
