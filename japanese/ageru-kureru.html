        <h1> Ageru vs Kureru</h1>
        <hr>

        <p>
            The verbs Ageru (あげる) and Kureru (くれる) both mean "to give" in English. However they are not synonyms, in
            Japanese only one of the two is correct in any situation.
        </p>

        <h2 id="speakerinvolved">Giving where the speaker is involved</h2>

        <p> The difference between these two verbs is quite simple when the speaker is involved. Both verbs mean "to
            give" however, Ageru is used when the speaker gives something so<strong>「私がYにXをあげる」</strong> <em>"I give X
                to Y"</em> and Kureru is used when something is being given to the speaker so
            <strong>「Yが私にXをくれる」</strong> <em>"Y gave X to me"</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            A useful mnemonic is that Ageru starts with the A, just like "I" or "wAtashi". So you should use Ageru for
            wAtashi.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now which verb do we use when the sentence does not include ourselves? This is a bit more complicated. To
            explain this you have to learn about a distinction between 2 types of people:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Your inner circle, people you are close with. This basically includes your friends and family.</li>
            <li>Your outer circle, anyone who is not in your inner circle.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            These groups are also referred to as Uchi (内) and Soto (外) and are an important distintion in not only
            Japanese language but also in their culture. This same distinction is used when deciding whether you use
            polite or impolite speech.
        </p>

        <p>
            So which groups gets which verb? When I is neither giver nor receiver, you have to check if Uchi is in the
            sentence, if Uchi is the giver you use Ageru, when they are the receiver you use Kureru. Finally when there
            is only Soto, you use Ageru. Below is a table with the overview.

            There is also a verb "Morau" which means "to receive", which can be used in any situation so you don't have
            to worry about all of this. Moreover you should know that ageru and kureru can also be used to mean other
            things than "to give", for example you can use Ageru (and Morau) to ask favors. But all of this is better
            explained in the sources you see below.
